Syncing Google Calendar and Remind
==================================

`Remind`_ is kind of awesome. Here is a less awesome way to sync it with Google
Calendar. I use this primarily to sync between my Android phone and the
reminders on my local computer.

Remind to Google Calendar
-------------------------

1.  Have a publicly accessible server.
2.  Use the `rem2ics`_ script to generate an ``.ics`` file periodically in
    a cron job.
3.  Automatically upload the generated ics file to the server. I do this via
    ``scpy`` and authorized public keys.
4.  Subscribe to this publicly accessible ``.ics`` file from Google Calendar.

Google Calendar to Remind
-------------------------

1.  Make a calendar in Google Calendar. This is where you'll add your events to
    from your mobile phone. Make this calendar the default calendar.
2.  Use this `prune_gcal.py`_, which grabs all the events in the default
    calendar in your Google account, deletes them, and outputs them in the
    reminders format.
3.  Setup a configuration file in ``~/.prune_gcal``, where the first line is
    the Google account username, and the second line is the password. E.g.::

        myemail@gmail.com
        mypassword
4.  Add this to a cron job::

        prune_gcal.py >> ~/.reminders 2>/dev/null

And that should let you use Remind as you normally would on your PC, and Google
Calendar on your phone.

The only caveat here is that your schedule would be publicly accessible
somewhere, but you can either have it under an HTTPS URL (note that Google
requires you to have a valid certificate; a self-generated certificate would not
work), and/or have an obscure URL.
