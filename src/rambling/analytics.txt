Embedding Google Analytics on Every Page
========================================

I wanted to embed Google Analytics on every page of this site, including all
possible error pages. This site is pretty heterogenous, in that not all pages
are managed by the same content generator. So if I were to use some
template-based footer that included this, I'd have to duplicate in various
places and keep track of duplications manually.

Alternatively, I could use `.htaccess` to setup each page so it is parsed as
PHP, which automatically appends the code snippet. But, seriously? PHP?

So it turns out Apache has a built-in module called `mod_substitute`_, which is
basically `sed`. I have the following defined for my virtual host::

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ...
        <Location />
            AddOutputFilterByType SUBSTITUTE text/html text/plain
            Substitute "s|</body>|<script type='text/javascript'>var gaJsHost = (('https:' == document.location.protocol) ? 'https://ssl.': 'http://www.');document.write(unescape('%3Cscript src=\'' + gaJsHost + 'google-analytics.com/ga.js\' type=\'text/javascript\'%3E%3C/script%3E'));</script><script type='text/javascript'>try {var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker('UA-12849586-1');pageTracker._setDomainName('.oliverzheng.com');pageTracker._trackPageview();} catch(err) {}</script></body>|i"
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>

With that, each page is `sed`'ed on the fly just before it is given to the
client browser. My code snippet is inserted right before `</body>`. Yes, all
that has to be on one line (it's `sed`) and, yes, that quote escaping is ugly,
but it works simply and quickly.
