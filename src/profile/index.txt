Profile
=======

I am an undergraduate student in the department of `Computer Engineering`_ in
the `University of British Columbia`_. This is located in Vancouver, British
Columbia of Canada, mountains and pretty Asian girls galore.

I enjoy learning new things and figuring out how they work, technical or just
generally in the world. Perhaps the only things I like more than that is thrill
from uncertainty, and, ironically, pondering upon unproductively and repeatedly
the unfathomable inquiry as to whether uncertainty carries any meaning at all or
if the conceivable world we perceive is a predetermined illusion that raises
the question that matters most - do we exist at all?
